# How to collaborate

Third-party contributions are how we keep the code samples great. Blackbaud simply can't create every conceivable code sample. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that show others how to do cool things with the Blackbaud CRM SDK and API. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

Below is an outline of the high level steps required to grab the code, begin making changes, and optionally contribute your work back to the community.

* Have a basic understanding of Github.  Additional details of our workflow are provided in the [detailed contributing document](CONTRIBUTING-DETAILS.md).
* Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork - Fork the appropriate [blackbaud-community](https://github.com/blackbaud-community) repository.  Now you've got your own version to play with. 

## Make Changes

* Clone - Clone your fork to your local computer.  Now the code for your fork is on your machine.
* Branch - Get off the master branch by setting up a development branch.
* Hack - Hack away!  Begin making local changes to the code within your new development branch.  
* Commit - Commit your local changes (things are still local at this point).

## Submit Changes
* Push - Push your local changes up to your fork on GitHub.com
* Sign - ***[Sign the CLA before you submit a Pull Request](http://www.bbdevnetwork.com/cla/)***
